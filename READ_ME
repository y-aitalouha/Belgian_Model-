# Belgian Energy System Model – Low-Carbon Fuels Integration

This repository contains the full modeling framework developed as part of a Master’s thesis focused on the integration of low-carbon fuels into the Belgian energy system under a carbon neutrality constraint by 2050.  
The project relies on a multi-energy optimization model implemented using the Graph-Based Optimization Modeling Language (GBOML) and Python-based post-processing tools.

## Repository Structure

The project folder is organized as follows:

### 📁 Data
This folder contains all input time series used in the simulations, including:
- Electricity demand and renewable generation profiles  
- Methane and Hydrogen demands
- Methane import
- Low carbon fuel demand for heavy transport 

---

### 📁 Modules
This folder contains all custom Python modules used throughout the project.  
It includes utility functions for:
- Data processing and aggregation  
- Scenario handling  
- Post-processing of model outputs  
- Plotting and visualization tools

---

### 📁 Templates
This folder contains all GBOML node and component templates implemented in the model, such as:
- Production units  
- Storage systems  
- Conversion processes  
- Transport and import/export nodes  

These templates are reused across different model configurations and scenarios.

### 📁 Models_GBOML
This folder contains the three GBOML energy system models developed in this project, representing different configurations of the Belgian energy system.  
Each model defines the system structure, constraints, and interactions between energy carriers.

---

### 📁 Launch
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used to:
- Configure and launch simulations  
- Run different scenarios and sensitivity analyses  
- Manage model inputs and outputs  

---

### 📁 Analyser
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the analysis of simulation results, including:
- Energy balances  
- Cost breakdowns  
- Technology deployment   

---

### 📁 Plots
This folder stores all figures generated during the analysis phase.
All plots used in the thesis are saved in this directory.

## Usage

1. Prepare or update input data in the `Data` folder.
2. Select the desired GBOML model in `Models_GBOML`.
3. Run simulations using the notebooks in `Launch`.
4. Analyze results using the notebooks in `Analyser`.
5. Generated plots are automatically saved in the `Plots` folder.
